# Walmart-Weekly-Sales-Data-Forecasting-Time-Series-Analysis

Sales forecasting is one of the key puzzle for retail industry. It is very important to have an estimated of forecasted items for a retail business to avoid issues like out of stock scenarios and delay in delivery/shipment, and so on. These can be potential reasons of observing drop in sales. Moreover, often on holidays, the sale is high. So analysing sales and products sold specifically during the holiday season can help the retail business to better prepare with promotional & exciting offers on products so that enough items are available and sales is skyrocekted. 

Time series analysis is a prime aspect of demand & supply chain process & can help predict the sales and create an optimal supply chain system. In this project, I've utilized Walmart Stores Dataset available on Kaggle, which consists of weekly sales data across 45 stores and approximately 81 departments. Along with this, addition.l information CPI, unemployement, Fuel Price, Holiday during sales is also provided.

Methods used:

1. Time Series Analysis (AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA, ARCH)
2. Machine Learning Models (Regression- Linear Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost)
3. Deep Learning (LSTM)
